      <h2>Statement</h2>
      <p>We are nature. Our bodies are earth, our souls like wind, and we feel the mysterious pull of our mortality and sensuality when engaged with the landscape. This reality is both internal and external. It includes ancient stories, past dreams, and the infinite space inside of us. A place where our minds escape and our bodies dwell-the human landscape.</p>
      <p>In the words of Marcel Duchamp, "Art must be part of life-not an interpretation of life, not a description of life, not an attempt to comment on or improve on life, but a piece of life itself." It is because of this, that the human form is the medium in which I work.</p>
      <p>Utilizing multiple mediums including photography, video, sound, dance, and performance to convey experience, the body is always present, and is crucial to my process of relating ideas. Most essential is live performance, as the art is experienced as it is made. It is inside the performer. It is in their breath, their movements, and their stories, blurring the distinction between life and art.</p>
